# Adding CSS

An introduction to CSS, adding color and a little bit of style to your web pages. If you and your group have any questions, or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1.  If you haven’t already completed the previous exercise, please start [here](https://richmccue.github.io/html-css/act-2.html){:target="_blank"}, as this part builds on the topics from the previous section.
2.  So far, you should have **AT LEAST? AT MOST?** two html pages, some with text and one with text and images. They all should have at least one link to another page. Even with all this lovely text your pages probably look quite plain. That’s where CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheets) comes into play.
3.  CSS is a different language than html and has different rules and structure. It is used to alter the presentation of a website and doesn’t hold any new content to the web. This means that the same html file can appear dramatically different depending on how CSS is used.
4.  **Linking CSS Stylesheet**

6.  There are a lot of different properties that we can change. Each element has a selection of what can be changed, but there are many shared between elements. No one is expected to memorise all of them, but it’s good to know the main ones and the rest you can always look up. Here are a few to start playing with:
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
7.  Now add more blocks for different types of tags. Here are some suggestions:
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf
    -   asdf

9.  CSS files can be used for multiple html pages and a single html page can have multiple CSS stylesheets.
10.  Try adding your new CSS file to other HTML files.

[NEXT STEP: title](act-4.html){: .btn .btn-blue }
