# Next Steps

Now that you have some exposure to coding in HTML and CSS, it's time to apply that knowledge. Your goal is to build an about me page. The page doesn’t have to be about you, it can be about a fictional or historical or celebrity figure. Try to include the tools from the workshop like: images, links, color, and flex boxes. Before you start on your about me page it's recommended to plan beforehand with pen and paper. This way you can visualize your page before making it.

## Create Your Own Public Website

If you eventually want to have your website available on the internet, a great place to start is [GitHub Pages](https://uviclibraries.github.io/twine/github.html){:target="_blank"} because they can host your files for free (this is a DSC step-by-step tutorial). 

Uvic also offers hosting services for free for [students](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/services/web/webhosting-students/index.php){:target="_blank"} and [faculty](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/web/webhosting-fac-staff/index.php){:target="_blank"} but you will lose access to your UVic space one year after you graduate. Uploading to your UVic web space is not as easy as using Github for your web hosting. Other non-UVic hosting services are available, but typically charge a monthly/annual fee.

## Use a HTML/CSS Template

Most website developers do not create their websites from scratch, but will use a template as a starting point and then modify and extend the tempalte to meet their needs. One of the more popular templates that can be used free of charge, and without any licensing restrictions is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

From the Bootstrap website: "Build fast, responsive sites with Bootstrap. Powerful, extensible, and feature-packed frontend toolkit. Build and customize with Sass, utilize prebuilt grid system and components, and bring projects to life with powerful JavaScript plugins."

You can learn more about the Bootstrap website here: [Bootstrap Website & Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank"}

## Add More features to Your Website

Now that you have the basic building blocks for a website, you can start to design your own. It is recommended that before you start coding, you sketch out ideas on pen & paper. It can be helpful to think about what you can do using the tools you have, but you shouldn’t shy away from trying to design something out of your current scope. It may take some research and trial & error, but there are plenty of resources available with helpful tutorials on how to implement all kinds of designs.
-   [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/){:target="_blank"} is a great resource that has examples and simple explanations on both HTML and CSS.
-   [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags){:target="_blank"} is a forum where coders of all levels ask and answer questions. There are many questions that have already been answered and chances are your question has already been answered.

## Debugging

Running into errors is to be expected when coding. The important thing is to know how to start debugging and solving the issues. Before posting on a forum or searching the web for answers, try to review your code for common errors like the following:
-   A missing closing tag </p>
-   Missing quotations
-   Odd number of brackets “(” or missing brackets.
-   Remember to add a semicolon at the end of a rule in CSS.
-   Writing “30 px” instead of “30px” for measurements in CSS.

## JavaScript

If web development has gotten you excited and you’d like to continue, JavaScript (JS) could be the next language to learn. JS offers additional functionality to websites that will expand what your website can do.
