# Next Steps

Now that you have some exposure to coding in HTML and CSS, it's time to apply that knowledge! You can continue to work on your "About Me" (`about.html`) page or start something new from scratch. We recommend planning what you want your web page(s) to look like _before_ you start coding. Some web designers prefer to visualize their pages with pen and paper and others use [wireframing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) tools to create website mockups. 

## Create your own public website

If you eventually want to have your website, GitHub Pages is great place to start is because GitHub can host your files for free. Check out the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site to learn more. 

The University of Victoria also offers free hosting services for [students](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/services/web/webhosting-students/index.php) and [faculty](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/web/webhosting-fac-staff/index.php), but be advised that you will lose access to your UVic web space one year after you graduate.

## Use a HTML/CSS template

Most website developers do not create their websites from scratch, but will use a template as a starting point and then modify and extend the template to meet their needs. One of the more popular templates that can be used free of charge, and without any licensing restrictions, is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). 

The W3Schools website has a helpful tutorial for Bootstrap websites: [Make a Website with Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website_bootstrap.asp). 

## More website design resources

In no particular order, here's a list of popular web-design resources: 

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a great resource that has well-written explanations and "sandboxes" for you to test practically any aspect of HTML and CSS, and more.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) is a forum where coders of all levels ask and answer questions. Chances are, your web-design questions have already been asked and answered here.
- [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) offers a number of tutorials on what is now the world's most popular programming language.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_content=blognavbar) is Codecademy is an online interactive platform that offers free coding classes in 12 different programming languages, including Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, Ruby, SQL, C++, C#, and Swift, as well as markup languages HTML and CSS.
