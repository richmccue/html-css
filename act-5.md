# Next Steps

Now that you have some exposure to coding in HTML and CSS, it's time to apply that knowledge! You can continue to work on your "About Me" (`about.html`) page or start something new from scratch. We recommend planning what you want your web page(s) to look like _before_ you start coding. Some web designers prefer to visualize their pages with pen and paper and others use [wireframing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) tools to create website mockups. 

## Create your own public website

If you eventually want to have your website, GitHub Pages is great place to start because the GitHub can host your files for free. Check out the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site to learn more. 

The University of Victoria also offers free hosting services for [students](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/services/web/webhosting-students/index.php) and [faculty](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/web/webhosting-fac-staff/index.php), but students be advised that you will lose access to your UVic web space one year after you graduate.

## Use a HTML/CSS template

Most website developers do not create their websites from scratch, but will use a template as a starting point and then modify and extend the template to meet their needs. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), which is free of charge and licensing restrictions, is a popular template framework. The W3Schools website has a helpful tutorial for Bootstrap websites: [Make a Website with Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website_bootstrap.asp).
